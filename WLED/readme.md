setColor([hue: 120, saturation: 100, level: 75])
setColorTemperature(3000)
```

### **Unified Control (Name or ID)**
```groovy
// All commands accept either a name or an ID number
setEffect("Rainbow", 150, 200, "Party")  // Set effect by name, with speed, intensity, and palette
setEffect(9, 128, 128, 11)              // Same command works with IDs

setPalette("Ocean")                     // Set palette by name
setPalette(22)                          // Set palette by ID

setPreset("My Favorite")                // Set preset by name
setPreset(5)                            // Set preset by ID

setPlaylist("Evening Routine")          // Set playlist by name
setPlaylist(3)                          // Set playlist by ID
```

### **Advanced Preset Management**
```groovy
// Save current state to a new preset with an auto-assigned ID
saveCurrentAsPreset("My New Look")

// Save current state, overwriting preset ID 15
saveCurrentAsPreset("My Updated Look", 15)

// Create a complex new preset (or update existing) with custom parameters
// Creates preset with ID 11, name "Red Alert", brightness 200, Strobe effect, and red color
savePreset("Red Alert", 11, 200, "Strobe", null, 255, 255, "FF0000")

// Delete preset by ID
deletePreset(12)

// Advance to the next preset in the running playlist
nextPresetInPlaylist()
```

### **Nightlight Control**
```groovy
setNightlight(10, "Fade", 50)  // Turn on nightlight for 10 mins, fade mode, 50/255 brightness
nightlightOff()                // Turn off nightlight
```

### **Reverse Effect Control**
```groovy
reverseOn()              // Turn reverse effect ON
reverseOff()             // Turn reverse effect OFF
toggleEffectDirection()  // Toggle current direction
```

### **Discovery & Management**
```groovy
listEffects()           // Show all available effects with IDs
listPalettes()          // Show all available palettes with IDs
listPresets()           // Show all available presets with IDs
listPlaylists()         // Show all available playlists with IDs
getDeviceInfo()         // Get WLED firmware version and device info
testConnection()        // Test connection health
forceRefresh()          // Force a full refresh of all data from the device
```

## ü§ù Credits & Support

- **Original Driver:** Bryan Li (bryan@joyful.house)
- **Rewrite & Enhancements:** Oliver Beisser

This driver is tested with WLED v0.13+ and is optimized for the Hubitat C-8 platform, while remaining compatible with older hubs.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Connection Issues**
- Check WLED URI format: `http://192.168.1.123` (no trailing slash)
- Verify network connectivity between Hubitat and WLED device
- Use `testConnection()` command to diagnose issues
- Enable debug logging for detailed error information
- Check connection state attribute for detailed status:
  - `connected` - Normal operation
  - `timeout` - Network timeout issues
  - `unreachable` - Device not responding
  - `protocol_error` - WLED API communication issues

### **Effect/Playlist Not Found**
- Use `listEffects()`, `listPalettes()`, or `listPlaylists()` to see available options
- Try partial name matching: "fire" instead of "Fire 2012"
- Check spelling and capitalization
- Refresh device with `forceRefresh()` to reload lists
- Verify WLED firmware version compatibility (v0.13+ recommended)

### **Backward Compatibility**
- **Legacy Rule Machine Rules**: Existing rules using integer IDs (e.g., `setEffect(15, 0, 100, 0)`) continue to work seamlessly
- **Mixed Usage**: You can mix IDs and names in the same command: `setEffect(15, 128, 128, "Rainbow")`
- **String IDs**: Both `setEffect(15, ...)` and `setEffect("15", ...)` are supported
- **Migration**: No need to update existing automations - they remain fully compatible
- **Method Signatures**: The driver automatically detects whether you're passing numbers or strings

### **Performance Issues**
- Reduce polling frequency if experiencing hub slowdown
- Enable auto-retry for better reliability with exponential backoff
- Check connection state regularly
- Monitor logs for network errors
- Consider disabling connection monitoring on stable networks
- Use batch operations when possible (multiple commands in sequence)

### **Memory and Stability**
- Avoid excessive polling on devices with many effects/palettes
- Monitor hub memory usage if using multiple WLED devices
- Clear device logs periodically to prevent memory buildup
- Restart driver if experiencing persistent connection issues
